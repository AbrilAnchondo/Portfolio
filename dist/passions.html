                <span class="passion">Dance </span>
                I am a former professional dancer. Ballet, body conditioning and
                other types of dance were part of my daily life. This type of
                art contributed to developing a deep sense of commitment to
                focusing and learning quickly. Dancing gave me the opportunity
                to travel, have cultural experiences and work in many different
                settings. In the past few years I joined the Lindy Hop community
                here in NYC which has been a delightful source of happiness,
                friendships and lots of dancing.

                I've always had the desire to see more of the world and I
                luckily share that passion with my husband. We dream of seeing
                it all and we are always excited to plan the next trip. Seeing
                the natural world and experiencing other cultures is life
                enriching, it makes me feel open, creative and more appreciative
                of what I already have.

                I have deep respect for the power and beauty of the natural

                innovations that offer a path to harmonious coexistence between
                humans and nature.

                Handmade items are special to me, I truly admire the thought and
                skill put into their creation. I find that most of the time they
                teach us something about somebody, about culture or about
                ourselves. I like to challenge myself by learning new things, I
                taught myself how to sew, crochet, embroider and do macrame and
                love to spend some of my free time doing DIY projects.

                Learning about global problems like climate change and health
                made me question a lot of my personal choices, it shifted my
                perspective and made me realise that I can take ownership of my
                health and my impact on the planet. Having that power led me to
                make healthier food choices and think more about how to live in
                ease rather than disease.

                I've been practicing yoga for about 9 years and this is how I
                first learned about "being mindful". The practice on the yoga
                mat taught me empathy, acceptance, resilience and then I
                extended this knowledge to other areas of my life. This has been
                a valuable contribution to my ongoing personal development and
                provides a framework to nurture meaningful relationships in my
                life.
