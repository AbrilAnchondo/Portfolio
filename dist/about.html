            <p>
              I am a developer and a former professional dancer. I had a career
              in dance for more than twenty years throughout Mexico, Italy, and
              New York City. I had the pleasure to be on big stages including
              Teatro dell’Opera di Roma, Bellas Artes (Mexico), Muscat Opera
              House (Oman), and Town Hall (NYC). For my last big production I
              was Guest Principle Dancer with Calpulli Mexican Dance Company,
              based in Queens, NY.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I was wrapping up my dance career, I developed a great interest
              in the intersection of technology and sustainability - a subject I
              am very passionate about. I took action by devoting time to online
              courses, and that is how I discovered my love of programming,
              which led me to enroll in The Flatiron School.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Flatiron I completed an immersive full stack software
              engineering program including 500 hours of on campus learning. The
              curriculum included Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, and
              utilizing Git. The program's most valuable gifts for me were
              developing my problem solving skills and strengthening my
              excitement for independent learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition from dance to tech has been a major decision in my
              life. In my dance career I had the opportunity to work with people
              from different backgrounds and to develop a deep commitment to
              focusing, learning fast, and being a team player. I’m excited to
              apply these skills at a tech company that aligns with my values,
              where I can have an opportunity to make a real difference with
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently reside in NYC. I'm a native Spanish speaker, English
              is my second language, and I am also fluent in Italian.
