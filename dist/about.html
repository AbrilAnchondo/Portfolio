            <p>
              I am a developer and a former professional dancer. I had a career
              in dance for more than twenty years throughout Mexico, Italy, and
              New York City. I had the pleasure to be on big stages including,
              Teatro dellâ€™Opera di Roma, Bellas Artes (Mexico), Muscat Opera
              House (Oman), Town Hall (NYC). My last big production was with
              Calpulli Mexican Dance Company. A Queens, NY, based Mexican folk
              dance company. I participated in two of their ballet - folklore
              productions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I was wrapping up my dance career, I developed a great interest
              in the intersection of technology and sustainability. I took
              action by devoting time to online courses, and that is how I
              discovered my passion for code, which led me to enroll in The
              Flatiron School.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Flatiron, I did an immersive Full stack software engineering
              program. Over 500 hours of on campus learning. The curriculum
              includes: Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React. This has been a
              major decision decision in my life, gateway to transition into a
              new career. The program's most valuable gift is teaching how to
              learn, problem solving and interacting with people that share
              similar interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              An essential component of my transition into tech is to find a
              company that is a leader in its industry and also aligns with my
              values, providing an opportunity to make a real difference with
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am excited about great ideas that bring together groups of
              people to work on innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My artistic background has given me the opportunity to travel,
              work with people from different backgrounds and develop a deep
              commitment to focusing and learning fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have great enthusiasm and self-motivation to learn new things to
              add to my skill set, one of the things I enjoy the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a native Spanish speaker, English is my second language, and I
              am also fluent in Italian.
